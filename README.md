- **Python (FastAPI):** The application backend is developed in Python using the FastAPI framework, known for its high performance and ease of use for building asynchronous and robust APIs. This enables efficient integration between business logic, database, and Stellar blockchain interaction.
- **PostgreSQL:** A robust, open-source relational database used to store application data such as user profiles, token information, transaction history, and other operational data that complement on-chain records.
- **Docker:** Used for application containerization, ensuring consistent development and production environments and facilitating deployment and scalability.
- **AI Tools:** Implemented for data analysis and optimization. Include machine learning algorithms to predict sports asset performance, analyze market trends, and personalize user recommendations, adding predictive value to the platform.
- **Git/GitHub:** For version control and project development collaboration.
- **Uvicorn:** High-performance ASGI server to run the FastAPI application.
- **Pydantic:** For data validation and serialization, ensuring the integrity of data flowing through the API.

## Technical Project Workflow

TrackTrade's technical workflow is modular and distributed, ensuring resilience and scalability:

1. **User Interface (Frontend):** Users interact with the platform through a web interface. This interface sends requests to the backend via RESTful API.
2. **Backend (FastAPI):** The FastAPI server receives requests from the frontend. It is responsible for:
   - **Authentication and Authorization:** Manages user access to the platform.
   - **Business Logic:** Processes requests, applies business rules, and coordinates operations.
   - **Database Interaction:** Stores and retrieves operational data from PostgreSQL (e.g., user profiles, off-chain transaction history).
   - **Stellar Blockchain Interaction:** Uses Stellar SDK to create and manage Stellar accounts, issue and manage tokenized assets, and submit transactions to the Stellar network.
3. **Stellar Blockchain (Soroban):** The Stellar network acts as the distributed and immutable ledger. Smart contracts (Soroban) are deployed here and execute programmed logic for tokenization, governance, and other critical operations, ensuring decentralization and trust.
4. **Monitoring Agent (`monitoring_agent.py`):** A background service that monitors the Stellar network for relevant events (e.g., new transactions, smart contract state updates) and updates the local database or triggers other actions as needed. This ensures synchronization between the application's on-chain and off-chain state.
5. **AI Integration:** AI modules consume platform data (transaction history, asset performance) to generate predictive insights and recommendations, which are then made available to the backend and, consequently, the frontend.
