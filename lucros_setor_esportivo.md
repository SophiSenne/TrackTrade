# Report: Profits in the Sports Sector

## Introduction

The global sports sector is a dynamic, billion-dollar market, offering profit opportunities for investors, administrators, and athletes. This report synthesizes key information about these profits, focusing on data and trends, using comparative tables for clarity and conciseness. Growing professionalization, globalization, and technological innovation, such as blockchain, are redefining value generation and distribution in this market.

## Investor Profits

Investment in sports is increasingly attractive, with interest from institutional investors and private equity [Deloitte, 2025]. The resilience of the sports market makes it a promising asset class.

### Investment in Crypto Assets and Blockchain

Crypto assets like fan tokens and NFTs allow individual investors to access the sports market, offering direct engagement and appreciation potential. Specialized funds in sports crypto assets are also emerging. It is crucial, however, to be aware of the volatility and inherent risks in this developing market [Exame, n.d.].

### League and Competition Revenues

Sports leagues and competitions generate billions annually, primarily through broadcasting rights, sponsorships, and ticket sales. In 2023, 14 analyzed leagues generated US$ 80.6 billion, a 22% growth since 2019. With Olympic Games and FIFA World Cup, the total reaches US$ 97.6 billion [Sports Value, 2024].
